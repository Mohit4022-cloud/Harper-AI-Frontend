## 📊 Performance Considerations

- Mock API responses include realistic delays (300-1500ms)
- 5% random error rate in development for testing
- Optimized bundle size with dynamic imports
- Efficient state management with Zustand
- Lazy loading for heavy components

## 🔒 Security Features

- CORS protection with whitelisted origins
- Security headers on all responses
- Input validation on API endpoints
- Error messages sanitized in production

## 📝 Development Guidelines

1. **Code Style**: Follow existing patterns, use TypeScript strict mode
2. **Components**: Prefer server components, use 'use client' only when needed
3. **Error Handling**: Always use try-catch with proper error types
4. **Testing**: Write tests for new features
5. **Performance**: Monitor bundle size, use lazy loading
