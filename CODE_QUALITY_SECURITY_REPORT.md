# Code Quality and Security Assessment Report

## Executive Summary

I've conducted a comprehensive code quality and security assessment of the Harper AI frontend project. The codebase shows good security practices overall, with proper input validation, CSRF protection, and security headers. However, there are areas that need attention.

## 1. ESLint Code Quality Issues

### Summary

- **Total Warnings**: 156
- **Most Common Issues**: Unused variables and imports
- **Critical Issues**: None found

### Key Findings:

- Many unused variables (156 warnings) that should be cleaned up
- No critical errors or blocking issues
- Code follows consistent patterns but needs cleanup

### Recommendations:

- Run `npm run lint -- --fix` to auto-fix some issues
- Manually review and remove unused imports/variables
- Consider stricter ESLint rules for production

## 2. Console.log Statements

### Summary

Found 85 files containing console statements that should be removed or replaced with proper logging.

### High-Priority Files with Console Statements:

- `/src/lib/env.ts` - Contains console.warn for missing API keys
- `/src/services/ai/geminiService.ts` - Debug logs for AI service
- `/src/middleware.ts` - Error logging
- `/src/app/api/` routes - Various debug statements

### Recommendations:

- Replace console.\* with the existing logger utility from `/src/lib/logger.ts`
- Use environment-based logging levels
- Remove all console statements in production builds

## 3. Hardcoded Secrets and API Keys

### Summary

**No hardcoded production secrets found!** ✅

### Good Practices Observed:

- All sensitive values are properly stored in environment variables
- `/src/lib/env.ts` provides proper validation and type safety
- Mock credentials are clearly marked and only used in development
- JWT secret validation prevents weak secrets in production

### Files Checked:

- `/src/lib/env.ts` - Uses environment variables properly
- `/src/config/twilio.ts` - Has mock values only for development
- No hardcoded API keys or secrets found in source code

## 4. Error Handling Patterns

### Summary

**Good error handling implementation found** ✅

### Strengths:

- Centralized error handler in `/src/lib/errorHandler.ts`
- Consistent error response format
- Proper error types and status codes
- Production vs development error message differentiation

### Areas for Improvement:

- Some API routes catch errors but only log them (e.g., email personalization route)
- Consider implementing retry logic for external service calls

## 5. Security Vulnerabilities

### XSS Protection ✅

- DOMPurify is properly implemented in `/src/lib/sanitize.ts`
- HTML content is sanitized before rendering
- Strict CSP headers in middleware

### SQL Injection Protection ✅

- Using Prisma ORM with parameterized queries
- Raw SQL queries use proper parameterization (e.g., search route)
- No string concatenation in queries

### CSRF Protection ✅

- CSRF token implementation in `/src/lib/csrf.ts`
- Tokens validated for state-changing requests
- Proper cookie configuration

## 6. Input Validation

### Summary

**Good validation practices** ✅

### Strengths:

- Zod schemas used for request validation
- Input sanitization utilities available
- File upload validation and sanitization

### Example from bulk operations:

```typescript
const bulkUpdateSchema = z.object({
  contactIds: z.array(z.string()).min(1).max(500),
  // Prevents processing too many items at once
})
```

## 7. Authentication/Authorization Patterns

### Summary

**Well-implemented auth system** ✅

### Strengths:

- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Proper token validation in API routes
- Role-based access control structure
- Session management with secure cookies

### Security Features:

- Password strength validation
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- Secure cookie configuration
- Token expiration and refresh mechanism

## 8. CORS and Security Headers

### Summary

**Comprehensive security headers** ✅

### Implemented Headers:

- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
- Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
- Referrer-Policy
- Permissions-Policy

### CORS Configuration:

- Environment-specific allowed origins
- Credentials support with strict origin checking
- Proper preflight handling

## 9. Deprecated API Usage

### Summary

No deprecated Next.js or React APIs found in use.

## 10. Unsafe Operations

### Areas of Concern:

1. **Raw SQL Queries**: The search functionality uses raw SQL but with proper parameterization
2. **File Uploads**: CSV upload functionality needs size limits
3. **Rate Limiting**: Currently only on auth endpoints, should extend to all APIs

### Recommendations:

1. Add file size limits to upload endpoints
2. Implement global rate limiting
3. Add request body size limits
4. Implement API versioning for future compatibility

## Overall Security Score: 8.5/10

### Strengths:

- Proper environment variable handling
- Good authentication implementation
- CSRF protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- Security headers properly configured
- No hardcoded secrets

### Areas for Improvement:

1. Remove console.log statements
2. Clean up unused variables (ESLint warnings)
3. Implement comprehensive rate limiting
4. Add file upload size restrictions
5. Implement request body size limits
6. Add API response time limits
7. Consider implementing API key rotation
8. Add security monitoring and alerting

## Immediate Action Items:

1. **High Priority**:

   - Remove all console.log statements
   - Implement file upload size limits
   - Extend rate limiting to all endpoints

2. **Medium Priority**:

   - Clean up ESLint warnings
   - Add request body size validation
   - Implement comprehensive error tracking

3. **Low Priority**:
   - Add API documentation
   - Implement security headers testing
   - Add automated security scanning to CI/CD

## Conclusion

The Harper AI frontend demonstrates solid security practices with proper authentication, input validation, and protection against common vulnerabilities. The main areas for improvement are code cleanup (unused variables, console statements) and extending security measures like rate limiting to all endpoints. The absence of hardcoded secrets and proper use of environment variables shows good security awareness.
